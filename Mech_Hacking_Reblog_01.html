  well... I suppose I could tell you <em>exactly</em> what I'm going to do with this access to all your thoughts and desires~
</p>

<p>
  I could start by reading your positive thoughts to 
  <span class="spoiler" onclick="this.classList.toggle('revealed')">
    find out all the little things you like about yourself, so I can casually slip a compliment about them into a normal conversation. Giving you just the slightest jolt of Reward Chems as I do, making you feel giddy and happy without knowing why. I'd get to watch as you slowly notice those things about yourself more and more often. Not stopping until it's enough to cloud out any of your "flaws", like having my wings permanently shrouding you
  </span>
</p>

<p>
  I could even read your deepest, darkest, thoughts and fears. Manipulating you by 
  <span class="spoiler" onclick="this.classList.toggle('revealed')">
    slowly and carefully unraveling the knotted threads of trauma and self-esteem. Targeting my praise and reassurance at that which ails you most deeply. Giving all the care that you need, all that you <em>deserve</em>. Not only because that's my job as your handler, no no no, but because I <em>want</em> to. I want to take care of you. I love helping you feel safe. And I will stop at nothing to make that happen. Even if that means taking complete control of your systems~
